(((
haven't yet decided how to link outlines and chapters together...
will it be that each outline will link to a chapter? multiple outlines to chapter? multiple chapters to outline?
any can be handled with link table, just need to figure out how i'd want it to be used....
or could just let it be open and people can make whatever links they want, it won't really matter...
**OUTLINELINK DB**
projectid int
outlineid int
chapterid int
